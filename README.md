# Observing Kit

A collection of Python tools and scripts for astronomical observation follow-up work, including downloading image stamps, creating finding charts, and analyzing quasar spectra.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into modules, each containing specialized tools for different aspects of observational astronomy:

- **`QSO_followup/`** - Tools for QSO (Quasi-Stellar Object) follow-up observations
  - Download optical and radio image stamps from various surveys
  - Generate finding charts with accurate WCS coordinates
  - Create radio-optical overlay visualizations
  - Plot quasar spectra

3. **Navigate to the module you need** and check its README for detailed usage instructions.

## Detailed Documentation

For detailed usage instructions, requirements, and examples, please refer to the README files in each directory:
